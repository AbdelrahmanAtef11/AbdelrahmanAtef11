I recently built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Zomato’s restaurant sales data. The goal was to uncover insights about customer behavior, sales performance, and cuisine preferences to support data-driven decision-making.

🔑 Key KPIs extracted from the dashboard:
💰 Total Sales: 986.6M
🛒 Total Sales Quantity: 2.4M items
📦 Orders Count: 300K+
⭐ Average Rating: 3.6
🌆 Top City Performance: Tirupati leads with 43M sales
🥗 Category Sales: Veg (122M) > Non-Veg (106M) > Others (24M)
📈 Yearly Sales Trend: Peak in 2018 (414M), followed by decline in later years
👥 Sales by Age: Majority of sales come from 25–30 years old customers
🍛 Cuisine Insights: Indian cuisine dominates (7.5M), followed by North Indian, Snacks, and Pizza

❓ Key Business Questions Answered:
Which city drives the highest sales?
What type of food (Veg vs Non-Veg) generates more revenue?
Which cuisines are most popular among customers?
How do sales vary by customer age groups?
What is the trend of yearly sales — are we growing or declining?
Which restaurants contribute the most sales and ratings?

💡 Suggestions based on analysis:
Focus on Veg items since they generate higher revenue compared to Non-Veg.
Improve average rating (3.6) by enhancing food quality & delivery speed.
Re-capture sales growth: Sales dropped after 2018 — explore marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and seasonal offers.
Target younger demographics (25–30 years) with personalized promotions.
Expand Indian cuisine variety as it’s the most demanded category.
Boost underperforming cities (e.g., Sultanpur, Vastrapur) with localized offers to increase sales share.
✨ This project shows how Business Intelligence tools like Power BI can provide deep insights into restaurant performance, helping decision makers focus on the right strategies for growth.
